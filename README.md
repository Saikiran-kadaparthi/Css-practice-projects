Daily HTML & CSS Practice
This repository contains my daily practice projects where I experiment with HTML & CSS.
I build small, creative UI components, layouts, and mini-projects every day to improve my front-end skills.

📅 Progress
✅ Practicing every day (at least one project per day)
✅ Focus on core web fundamentals
✅ No frameworks, only HTML & CSS

📂 Projects
Day 1 – 🎲 Dice Faces (All 6 dice faces made with HTML & CSS only)
Day 2 – 🔘 Glow Buttons (hover effects with glowing animation)
Day 3 – 🎨 Color Palettes (CSS palette UI design)
Day 4 – ⏰ Analog Clock UI (static UI with HTML & CSS only, not functional)
(More projects coming daily...)

🚀 Goals
Improve CSS layout & animation skills
Practice clean, reusable code
Build a daily coding habit

🛠️ Tech Stack

CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Animations, Transitions)

📌 Notes
These are practice projects, not production-ready apps.
The goal is learning by doing.
